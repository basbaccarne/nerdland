# nerdland
This repo covers the set-up of the nerdland installation.
- Interaction Design: Children can create their own paramertric design with an Arduino-controlled input device
- Computational Design: This device feeds a firefly + grasshopper script that generates matterns in a predefined format
- Advanced manufacturing: These shapes are exported as SVG files and laser cutted
- Design for Assembly: These personalised fragments can be assembled into a night lamp
